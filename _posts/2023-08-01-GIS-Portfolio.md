Hello! I'm Melissa. I'm a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) professional from San Jose, CA.

I've been working in the GIS field since 2008. I started my GIS career working for Channel Islands National Park. Since then, I've grown my GIS knowledge through approximately 12 years of experience in the public health, parks & recreation, utility, and public safety fields.

I love working on GIS projects that help improve community health. My favorite GIS projects were those that helped improve park access, increased drinking water and stormwater quality, and decreased 911 call response times.

I enjoy creating print maps, web maps, and dashboards, but I also find GIS data management, geoprocessing automation, and process improvement equally exciting.

I've included a few examples of my GIS work below. Feedback, comments, and questions are more than welcome. (Since I've spent a large portion of my career working with sensitive health and utility data, much of my work can't be displayed here. For more information about my past work, please see my resume below.)

## Mapping Applications

### Park Features Viewer
I created this app for park staff so they could explore park amenities and infrastructure (fences, gates, baseball fields, picnic tables, trails, etc.).

<p align="center">

</p>

### Park Watch Reporting App
I used Esri's Survey123 to allow park volunteers to submit information about park concerns (e.g. broken benches, downed trees). When volunteers submit this form, supervisors receive email notifications (thanks, Microsoft Flow!) and can track the concerns on a dashboard.

</p>

### Tree Inventory App
This app provided urban forestry staff with an easy way to batch edit tree information.

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/34cd0261-2815-4161-b5a0-7b35d8d3873e">
</p>

### Mobile Tree Data Collection
Building off my colleague's work, I maintained tools that allowed an urban forester to track trees, inspections, and simple work orders.

<p align="center">

</p>

### Safe Walking Routes Map
I designed this web map to show suggested walking routes for students. SAMI is a Science and Math Institute located within a large park.

<p align="center">
<img width="50%" height="50%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/cfd839cf-83a1-44f5-9812-eacceb5aed4a">
</p>

### Waterfront Mileage
This web map just shows mileage along a trail system.

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/f5e02e06-c856-4e96-a52b-9aadf9020685">
</p>

### Public Notification Address Finder
This app uses an ESRI widget. Users were able to export a list of addresses within a certain distance of parks or buildings. The address lists were then used to create mailers for public meetings.

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/cfbaa2e4-299d-4218-a7a1-89faa3fd70a3">
</p>

### Coyote/Raccoon Spotter
I used ArcGIS Online to allow community members to capture carnivore sightings. This tool used both Survey123 for ArcGIS and ArcGIS Hub. (Note: I can't take credit for the cool coyote logo.)

<p align="center">
<img width="30%" height="30%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/6959d811-7d02-4aee-917f-755c78fd9c12">
</p>

### Park Utility Viewer
I created this app for park operations and maintenance staff. It was the result of years of work collecting, scanning, and georeferencing as-builts, importing CAD data, digitizing utilities, and conducting utility field checks.

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/168b217d-f95f-4686-a77f-921cb10a6fdc">
</p>

### Park Walk Time Explorer
I made this Esri Story Map to visualize areas within 10 and 15 minute walks from Tacoma parks. (This was created prior to the City of Tacoma's involvement in the Trust for Public Land's cool Park Score analysis.) 

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/18812515-7897-4e4c-b140-f8575d2fdeed">
</p>

### Simple Mapbox Webmap
This is a very, very simple web map I built with Mapbox tiles and Mapbox GL JS. It shows the location, name, and address of Metro Parks Tacoma properties. I've always used Esri tools to create maps, so I wanted to try something different. I look forward to learning more about Mapbox's capabilities.

## Portals and Dashboards

### COVID Case and Contact Management System
With my GIS and epidemiologist coworkers, I maintained and built dashboards, web maps, and web apps that fed into this COVID case and contact management system. At the peak of COVID response, more than 150 staff members used this system.

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/afa179e3-0ce8-4d6d-9520-9afa0e4548d5">
</p>

### Parks Department GIS Portal
Working alongside my GIS colleagues, IT staff, and an ESRI advisor, I implemented Portal for ArcGIS on Microsoft Azure. After Portal was stood up, we created various tools for park staff and made them accessible via ArcGIS Enterprise Sites.

<p align="center">
<img width="80%" height="80%" src="https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/assets/140747457/82c046aa-f744-4519-a58f-ff6cf9668a9e">

### Anacapa Island Vegetation Transects Map
I made this map many years ago as an intern with Channel Islands National Park. 

<p align="center">

</p>

### Orchard Map
As an intern with Channel Islands National Park, I collected tree data at Smuggler's Cove and used it to create the following map.

### GIS Analysis for Prisoners Harbor Environmental Impact Statement
As an intern with Channel Islands National Park, I used GIS to aid in vegetation planning for a fill disposal site on Santa Cruz Island.

Please see Appendix C in [this PDF](https://github.com/melhayashida/GIS_Portfolio/files/12217932/48011.Prisoners.Harbor.FEIS.Appendicies.pdf).
