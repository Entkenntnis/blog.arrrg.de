## Cricket

### What is cricket?
Cricket is a second most viewed and popular team sport on the earth. Cricket is played between two teams of 11 players on each side. Matches are officiated over by two umpires. Their decisions in the game are final. Each team takes turns batting and playing the field, as in baseball. In cricket, the batter is a batsman and the pitcher is a bowler. The bowler tries to knock down the bail of the wicket. A batsman tries to prevent the bowler from hitting the wicket by hitting the ball.

### Scoring
The batters can run after the ball is hit. A run is scored each time they change places on the pitch. The team with the highest number of runs (typically in the hundreds) wins the match.
1. 6 runs: A ball hit out of the field on a fly.
2. 4 runs: A ball hit out of the field on a bounce.

### Dismissals
1. Bowled out: Bowler knocks over (breaks) the wicket with a bowl.
2. Caught out: Fielder catches a batted ball on the fly
3. Run out: Fielder catches ground ball and throws it at the wicket, knocking it down before the batsman gets there.
4. Leg before wicket: Batsman's body interferes with a bowled ball that would hit the wicket.

## History
Cricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies as early as the 17th century, and in the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the West Indies by colonists and to India by British East India Company mariners. Since then, the game evolved into several formates. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877.
