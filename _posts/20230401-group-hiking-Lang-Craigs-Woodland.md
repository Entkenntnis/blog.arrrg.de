We set out to appreciate Spring blossoms but it turned out that early April was still cold here in Scotland and there were not many blossoms yet especially in the mountain, but we were very much amazed at the stunning view overlooking the River Cylde and thick moss, quite dominant and beautiful covering many stone surfaces and tree trunks.

## Code

Source code can be included by fencing the code with three backticks. Syntax highlighting works automatically when specifying the language after the backticks.

````
```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
````

This would be rendered as:

```javascript
function foo () {
    return "bar";
}
```
