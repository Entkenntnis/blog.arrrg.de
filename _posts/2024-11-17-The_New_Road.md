# The new road for a junior Developer

As a Developer i finally reached my first intership,(i guess this will be a big hit), but i have to be honest, some activities aren't nor too mucha related to development, but i think that's the part from the unboarding i'll be facing to reach my goals...

Hope this will be a great sign for my career, to be honest this was a tuff year.
