**Era of massive data sets brings fascinating problems at the interfaces between information theory and
(statistical) learning theory.**

<br/>
There are various studied connections between information theory and statistics:
<ul>
  <li>Hypothesis testing, large deviations</li>
  <li>Fisher information, Kullback-Leibler divergence</li>
  <li>Metric entropy and Fanoâ€™s inequality</li>
  <li> etc...</li>
</ul>
<br/>
 In their classic paper, Kolmogorov and Tikhomirov(1959) make connections between statistical estimation, metric entropy and the notion of channel capacity. Let's write and draw this in information theoretic jargon. Let; <br/>
 
 **Codebook:** indexed parametric family of probability distributions $$\{Q_\theta | \theta|\
Theta\}$$ <br/>
 **Codeword:** nature chooses some <br/>
 **Channel:** user observes n i.i.d. draws <br/>
 **Decoding:** estimator <br/>
