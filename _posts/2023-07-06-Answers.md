# Questions for the process

## Agents
- Who is in the server pool? Is it the same server for different queues?
  - What is the relationship between the servers and the pool?
- Agent and handler numbers: Are these in different departments?
  - Can we add the team names to agents?
Anwer: 
This differ between the teams. In one team (the respondens team of 7 agents), all 7 agents are assigned to VIP queues, while max 2 of them are also assigned to SoHo. Internal calls can also occur, when a shop has an issue related to SoHo customers (i.e. the customer shows up in the shop). VIP is manned from 8-16, SoHo from 8-11.30, and 14-16.

## SLA
- What is the SLA of the different queues?
- What are the incentives to conform to the SLAs?
  - Any type of bonus that they dont get or so?
  - Is that on a individual or on a server-pool basis? or a mixture?
Answer: SoHo: 95% within 5 minutes (CAP5), VIP: 95% within 1 minute (CAP1)
There are no incentives for the individual agents. However, both agent and team is measured on their level of compliance.
 

## Calls/cases
- Can we differentiate the problem types/codes?
  - How reliable is errand_type? 
- Who is calling in? Only tech responsible/owners? or also employees of the enterprise customers?

Answer: On the VIP lines (BAMALAKA), it is mainly the administrator, phone or IT responsible in the customer company. On SoHo it is everyone: i.e. all employees with a B2B sub.
