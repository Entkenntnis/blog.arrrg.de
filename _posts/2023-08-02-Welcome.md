I am an economist turned statistician with research interests in latent variable modeling, psychometrics, multivariate data analysis, and causal inference. From September 2023, I will be a Research and Teaching Fellow in the Department of Statistics at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). I expect to receive my PhD in Statistics from LSE in September 2023, and I hold a MSc in Statistics and a BA Economics from Universidad Nacional de Colombia.
