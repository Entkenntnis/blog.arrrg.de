# Hi! Good to meet you.

My name is Ren√©.

I believe digital tools can bring academic research out of the ivory tower and into the lives of the people to whom it really matters.

I'm currently a PhD candidate at Yale University. My academic research is about Caribbean literature in the 20th century. Specifically, I've been writing about the Caribbean Festival of the Arts (Carifesta), one of the most important cultural events in the region.

To make my work more accessible, I'm creating a website called Carifesta Stories. This website will feature interactive maps, timelines, an oral history archive, and other audiovisual content.

I'm busy building relationships with librarians, archivists, community storytellers, and other researchers to make Carifesta Stories a reality.

On this page you'll find my updates about the project. If I'm going to help steward the history of these stories, accountability and transparency are indispensable.

You'll also find my traditional cv and resume here.

Let's chat!
