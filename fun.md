When the weather is nice, we would like to immerse ourselves in Scotland's natural wonders. While we enjoy Human Computer Interaction, we also have a lot of fun interacting with the scenary, the forest, the stream, the castle, the rainbow, the sunlight, the rain, the wind, and the wildlife while we are exploring mountains, lochs, woodlands, farmlands, and beaches that are just on our footstep in Glasgow.
