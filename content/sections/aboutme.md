Hi, I'm Shakked! I'm currently a first-year PhD student in the Economics Department at MIT. My research interests are in labor economics, political economy, and behavioral economics.

I'm originally from New Zealand, where I studied economics, math, and philosophy at Victoria University of Wellington. I then worked as a research assistant at Motu Economic & Public Policy Research and at MIT before starting my PhD.
