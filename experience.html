I started learning to code in 2021. I started by learning Javascipt, building basic html and CSS pges.
Right now I am taking courses in java, full stack development and software practices.
I don't have any formal experience working in the field yet, but i am hoping to increase my knowledge in programming, and apply for some internships soon.
