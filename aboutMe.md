| ![image](/assets/websiteProfile_small.png)      | I am a roboticist primarily focued on dynamics and controls in robotics with a master's degree in Robotics from the Johns Hopkins University and a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. My passion lies in developing robust and adaptive control schemes that allow robots to learn from their environment and dynamically adjust their control parameters based on feedback. The majority of my work has involved implementing control agorithms for trajectory generation, motion planning and for parameter identification in various systems such as manipulators, mobile robots and underwater robots. I also have experience in designing wiring harness schematics, testing Li-Ion battery quality and in battery management systems.
On this website, you will find a collection of my projects, research and related work. |
