# About Me

![me](../assets/images/head_shot.png){:width="400px" height="400px"}


Hello there! I'm Timothy, a software developer based in Toronto. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, experiences, and journeys.

## Background

I come from a STEM background, with a major in Computer Science & Math. Growing up in the age of the internet has provided me with endless resources to learn about math, science, and technology. Currently, I work as a full-time technical lead for a startup.

## What I Do

Despite being deeply immersed in STEM, I also love to engage my right hemisphere! You might find me playing or creating music when I'm not painting or drawing. 

In an effort to avoid withering away into dust, I also enjoy bouldering and playing all kinds of racquet sports!

## Gaming

I believe that video games are one of the best ways to stay connected with friends who can't meet in person. If I'm gaming, I usually spend my time on Riot Games, Tetris, chess, and other strategy or co-op games. Feel free to add me on Discord: dodoman767

## Blog

I believe passions can be greatly honed with discussion, critque and collaboration. I hope to leave some of my work and interests on display in hopes to inspire conversation and passion in topics I'm invested in.
