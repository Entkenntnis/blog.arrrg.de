    <p>Hello there! I'm Timothy, a software developer based in Toronto. Welcome to my corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, experiences, and journeys.</p>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I come from a STEM background, with a major in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. Growing up in the age of the internet has provided me with endless resources to learn about math, science, and technology. Currently, I work as a full-time technical lead for a startup.</p>

## What I Do

Despite being deeply immersed in STEM, I also love to engage my right hemisphere. You might find me playing or creating music when I'm not doodling or designing. 

In an effort to avoid withering away into dust, I also spend time bouldering and playing all kinds of racquet sports.

## Recreation

I believe that video games are one of the best ways to stay connected with friends who can't meet in person. If I'm gaming, I usually spend my time on Riot Games, Tetris, chess, and other strategy or co-op games. Feel free to add me on Discord: dodoman767

I'm currently in the middle of watching Vinland Saga and it's amazing! 

## Blog

I believe passions can be greatly honed with discussion, critque and collaboration. I hope to leave some of my work and interests on display in hopes to inspire conversation and passion in topics I'm invested in.
