## Welcome 

[![TransLoc Database](../assets/images/transloc.png)](http://translocations.in2p3.fr/index.php)

The *TransLoc Database* contains information about hundreds of populations of species that have been voluntarily translocated in the Western Palearctic, aiming at obtaining wild, viable populations. here is a map of the translocated populations.

[![TransLoc Database](../assets/images/map.png)](http://translocations.in2p3.fr/index.php)

* For every population, the location point shows the center of the locality where the translocated population was or is currently occurring, i.e., a municipality (most often) or a natural park, a reserve, an island, a cape, a peak, a lakeâ€¦ The accurate locations of the populations are not available on this map.

### You will find below precisions about:

* Population delimitation [link](#precisions-about-population-delimitation)
* Which translocated populations can be included in the database and which populations cannot, according to translocation type [link](#precisions-about-which-translocated-populations-can-be-included-in-the-database-and-which-populations-cannot-according-to-translocation-type)
* Geographical limits [link](#precisions-about-geographical-limits)
* The taxonomic kingdoms involved in the database [link](#precisions-about-the-taxonomic-kingdoms-involved-the-database)
* The information included, when available, in the database for every translocated population [link](#precisions-about-the-information-included-when-available-in-the-database-for-every-translocated-population)
* Our sources of information [link](#precisions-about-our-sources-of-information)
* Who we are and our funding sources [link](#precisions-about-who-we-are-and-our-funding-sources)
* How to contact us, participate, and get access to data and documents [link](#precisions-about-how-to-contact-us-participate-and-get-access-to-data-and-documents)

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.
