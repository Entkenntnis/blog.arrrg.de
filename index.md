## Welcome to the TransLoc Blog  

[![TransLoc Database](../assets/images/transloc.png)](http://translocations.in2p3.fr/index.php)

The *TransLoc Database* contains information about hundreds of populations of species that have been voluntarily translocated in the Western Palearctic, aiming at obtaining wild, viable populations. here is a map of the translocated populations.

For every population, the location point shows the center of the locality where the translocated population was or is currently occurring, i.e., a municipality (most often) or a natural park, a reserve, an island, a cape, a peak, a lake… The accurate locations of the populations are not available on this map.


### You will find below precisions about:

* Population delimitation [link](#precisions-about-population-delimitation)
* Which translocated populations can be included in the database and which populations cannot, according to translocation type [link](#precisions-about-which-translocated-populations-can-be-included-in-the-database-and-which-populations-cannot-according-to-translocation-type)
* Geographical limits [link](#precisions-about-geographical-limits)
* The taxonomic kingdoms involved in the database [link](#precisions-about-the-taxonomic-kingdoms-involved-the-database)
* The information included, when available, in the database for every translocated population [link](#precisions-about-the-information-included-when-available-in-the-database-for-every-translocated-population)

##### Precisions about population delimitation
We use a definition of the population from population biology theory, i.e., a group of organisms of the same species that live in a particular geographic area at the same time, with the capability of interbreeding. Concretely, given what we know about the species biology, the landscape structure and the geographical distance between separated groups of individuals, if we believe that gene flow due to the dispersal of individuals or diaspores (e.g. seeds, fruits) or gametes (e.g. through pollen) between these groups probably occurs only on few occasions per generation, then we consider these groups of individuals as distinct populations. 

It might be difficult in some cases to decide whether different groups should be bundled together in a single population. A priori, if the authors of a document related to a translocation use the word population, we will consider this entity as one population in the database. If the word population is not used, or if it appears clearly that it has a meaning different from the one defined above, we will delimitate populations according to our definition.

##### Precisions about which translocated populations can be included in the database and which populations cannot, according to translocation type
We include in the database populations that have been reinforced with individuals from abroad (reinforcement) or created in a site where the species had gone extinct before (reintroduction) or in a site where it has never occurred to our knowledge (introduction), with the objective of improving the viability (see Box) of the reinforced population or resulting in the viability of the created population. 

The necessary objective of viability can be one objective among others. For example, we include in the database populations that have been translocated with the double objective of obtaining both a viable population and data to improve further translocations (e.g. Colas et al. 2008, Noël et al. 2011), or with the double objective of obtaining a viable population as well as a so-called ecosystem service (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2005). We also include in the database translocated populations which viability is a particular goal included in a broader objective of, e.g., restoring a given community (e.g. Donath et al. 2007). 

On the contrary, we do not include populations that were translocated for experimental purpose only, such as reciprocal transplant experiments to test for local adaptation with no aim of improving population viability (e.g., Raabová et al. 2007), or survival experiments in artificial ecosystems like aquaculture tanks (e.g. Balestri et al. 2011). We neither include the translocation of game species with no population viability consideration like, e.g., the massive release of captive born birds for recreative shooting. We neither include in the database translocation cases where individuals were just displaced from their original site to close vicinity, allowing these individuals to be saved from, e.g., civil engineering, but where no reinforcement and no new population could be considered (e.g. Bruelheide and Flintrop 2000). 


> **Box on Population Viability**
>
> Viability is a concept from population dynamics theory. Given the probabilistic nature of individual survival, growth, reproduction, and dispersal, the persistence or extinction of a population in the future must be foreseen with probabilistic analysis. Sophisticated population viability analysis using demographic rates from individual monitoring and matrix models can be conducted to estimate extinction probabilities over a given time period (Beissinger and McCullough 2002). A population is then considered viable if its probability of extinction over a time period in the future is below a given threshold (e.g., less than 5% over 100 years). Practically, relevant demographic data sets allowing such sophisticated population viability analysis are scarce, and viability is often estimated using other indicators, such as those used by IUCN to classify species in Red List categories (A to D criteria in IUCN 2001). See Robert et al. (2015) for the use of red list criteria in the context of translocations.

##### Precisions about the information included, when available, in the database for every translocated population
For every translocated population, the TransLoc database gathers and standardizes data in 84 fields of information grouped in the following categories:

* Context
* Type/Phase
* Location
* Habitat type
* Biological material
* Interventions
* Post-RST monitoring (Release, Sowing, or Transplantation)
* Results
* Bibliography

Each category corresponds to one tab in the population pages of the website. The definitions of every field of information and of every possible response can be downloaded [here](http://translocations.in2p3.fr/view/BD-TransLoc_User-handbook.pdf).

Two additional tabs are available for every translocated population. The first tab records the number of translocated individuals per stage/age, year, and accurate location of RST. The second tab records the population size (including native individuals and/or translocated individuals and/or their descent) per stage/age and per year.
