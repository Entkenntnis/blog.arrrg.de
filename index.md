Hello, my name is Ryan and I am a second year [Computer Systems Engineer](https://warwick.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/compsysengmeng/) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).


Within the [Blog section](https://ryanbradshawcodes.github.io/blog/) I intend to keep a running log of everything I get up to. This will include:
* When I post content to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtMZAr3sYLpx91sQ8De4YbA)
* Projects
* LeetCode problems
