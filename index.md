I'm a Doctor of Philosophy in predictive and prescriptive process monitoring. I work as a data scientist in the telecommunications sector, focusing on problems at the intersection of customer value management and business process optimization. 

In my research on predictive process monitoring, I focus on timeliness and (in)consistent behavior of remaining time prediction models. I have also worked on the evaluation aspect of model development within this area. In prescriptive process monitoring, I have so far been focusing on the scheduling aspect (queue management) in customer service settings.

If you are interested in collaboration within these areas, feel free to reach out.

Best,<br>
Mike
