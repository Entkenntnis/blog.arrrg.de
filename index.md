Hi! I'm Shakked, a Predoctoral Research Fellow at MIT. I work for [Simon JÃ¤ger](https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/sjaeger) and [Benjamin Schoefer](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~schoefer/) on projects in labor economics.

Previously, I worked at [Motu Economic and Public Policy Research](https://www.motu.nz/) and studied economics, math, and philosophy at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.

I'm professionally interested in applied microeconomics, and non-professionally interested in metaethics, political philosophy, and [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/).
