Hi there, I am Daisy Han. 
A computer science student aspiring to become a software engineer. 
I started computer science program in 2021. 
I like it because it constantly pushes me to learn new things
It is especially rewarding for me when I am able to solve challenging problems. 
Right now I am focusing all my time on school.
Once school is less hectic, I hope to travel to middle east.
