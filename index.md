## About me 

Hi! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences](https://www.albany.edu/daes) 
at the [University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/), advised by [Dr. Brian Rose](https://brian-rose.github.io/).
I am generally interested in global climate change and large-scale dynamics. My current research uses climate models to 
explore how atmosphere–ocean–sea ice interactions influence radiative feedbacks and climate sensitivity. In particular, 
I am interested in how slow variability of the Southern Ocean could impact radiative feedbacks through pattern effects. 

I also have an interest in open science and contribute regularly to [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/), which is both a collection of geoscientific Python tutorials and a community of people passionate about Python and open, reproducible science.

In 2021, I received a BS in applied physics and mathematics from [Stockton University](https://stockton.edu/sciences-math/),
where I did some research in computational hydraulics. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and reading philosophy.

My full [CV can be found here](cv_ford.pdf).

## CESM tutorials and info

### Running CESM1.2.1 on the SNOW cluster at UAlbany

These two documents explain the process of running the version of CESM1 that was ported on one of the Department's computing clusters, SNOW. These are outdated, as the Department has moved to using a new cluster, but I may eventually update them.
