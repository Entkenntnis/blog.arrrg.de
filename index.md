Hi! I am a PhD student in the [Department of Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences](https://www.albany.edu/daes) 
at the [University at Albany, SUNY](https://www.albany.edu/), advised by [Dr. Brian Rose](https://brian-rose.github.io/).
I am generally interested in global climate change and large-scale dynamics. My current research uses climate models to 
explore how atmosphere–ocean–sea ice interactions influence radiative feedbacks and climate sensitivity. In particular, 
I am interested in how slow variability of the Southern Ocean could impact radiative feedbacks through pattern effects. 

I also have an interest in open science and contribute regularly to [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/), which is both a collection of geoscientific Python tutorials and a community of people passionate about Python and open, reproducible science.

In 2021, I received a BS in applied physics and mathematics from [Stockton University](https://stockton.edu/sciences-math/),
where I did some research in computational hydraulics. In my free time, I enjoy playing guitar and reading philosophy.
