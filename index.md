Hi, I'm Shakked! I'm currently a Predoctoral Research Fellow at MIT, working for [Simon JÃ¤ger](https://economics.mit.edu/faculty/sjaeger) and [Benjamin Schoefer](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~schoefer/) on projects in labor economics. In fall 2022, I'll start a PhD in Economics at MIT.

Previously, I worked at [Motu Economic and Public Policy Research](https://www.motu.nz/) and studied Economics, Math, and Philosophy at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.

On this website, you can find my [research](http://shakkednoy.com/research/) and my [CV](http://shakkednoy.com/cv.pdf).
