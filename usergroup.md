Image analysis user group consists of Rockefeller University researchers who are interested in sharing knowledge and learning from each other.  
We meet regularly to discuss the latest image analysis methods, pipelines, softwares or a new paper.

Please contact [Ved Sharma](mailto:vsharma01@rockefeller.edu) at the [Bio-Imaging Resource Center](https://www.rockefeller.edu/bioimaging/), if you want to join the group.

## User Group Meetings

### 6/23/2022 meeting minutes
Title: "How do I do “X” in ImageJ/Fiji?"  
Presenter: Ved Sharma, BIRC, The Rockefeller University  
Location/Time: 506 Greenberg Building (CRC), 2-3 pm

Following topics were discussed:
- Efficient menu and commands nagivation in ImageJ/Fiji with search bar, shortcuts, Action bar plugin and control panel
- Demonstrated "Synchronize Windows" feature for multichannel images; Wand tool for quickly outlining cells
- Set Measurements options
- Automated cell counting in fluorescence and color (RGB) images
- Described a pipeline for the quantification of nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of IF signal
- Tips on figure generation such as savings files as PNG, using Overlay option to annotate images and described some plugins such as QuickFigures,  OMERO.figure and FigureJ

### 9/8/2022 meeting minutes
Title: "Image segmentation"  
Presenter: Ved Sharma, BIRC, The Rockefeller University  
Location/Time: 506 Greenberg Building (CRC), 2-3 pm

Following topics were discussed:
- discussed phase contrast microspoy images from one of our users and demonstrated the limits of classical segmentation techniques and suitability of deep learning method, such as [Cellpose](https://www.cellpose.org/), for chanllenging segmentation problems.
- showed how sometimes processing raw images with classical filters (gaussian etc.) before feeding them into deep learning pipeline procudes better restults, than using the raw images in deep learning.
- discussed how to train a custom model in Cellpose using user data, if the built-in models do not produce accurate results.
- demonstrated the use to Cellpose on another user's fluorescence microcopy images, where cells were clustering together.
- demonstrated how to do 3D segmentation in Cellpose and then export the label image into Imaris for visualization and further analysis (e.g. filtering, cell/nuclei counting and other cellular measurements)
