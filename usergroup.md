Image analysis user group consists of Rockefeller researchers who are interested in learning image analysis.  
We meet regularly to discuss the latest image analysis methods, pipelines, softwares or a new paper.

Please contact [Ved Sharma](mailto:vsharma01@rockefeller.edu) at the [Bio-Imaging Resource Center](https://www.rockefeller.edu/bioimaging/), if you want to join the group.

## User Group Meetings

Notes from the user group meetings will be posted here.
