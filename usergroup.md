Image analysis user group consists of Rockefeller University researchers who are interested in sharing knowledge and learning from each other.  
We meet regularly to discuss the latest image analysis methods, pipelines, softwares or a new paper.

Please contact [Ved Sharma](mailto:vsharma01@rockefeller.edu) at the [Bio-Imaging Resource Center](https://www.rockefeller.edu/bioimaging/), if you want to join the group.

## User Group Meetings

Notes from the user group meetings will be posted here.
