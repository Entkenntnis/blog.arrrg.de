## Workshop
In this workshop, we will work through following exercises:
1. Segmentation using global threshold, local threshold and Deep Learning (StarDist)
2. Cell tracking using StarDist and TrackMate
3. Denoising using Noise2Void
4. Bonus – 3D segmentation using StarDist and TrackMate

### Installing appropriate plugins in your Fiji
We will be adding the following three [updates sites](https://imagej.net/update-sites/following) in our Fiji to install all the required plugins for this workshop:   
- [CSBDeep](https://imagej.net/plugins/csbdeep)
- [StarDist](https://imagej.net/plugins/stardist)
- [TrackMate-StarDist](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/trackmate-stardist)  
  
Step 1: Start Fiji.  
Step 2: Select Help > Update... from the menu bar.  
Step 3: Click on the button "Manage update sites".  
Step 4: Scroll down the list and tick the checkboxes for update sites CSBDeep (shown below), StarDist and TrackMate-StarDist, then click the Close button.

Step 5: Click on "Apply changes" to install the plugins.  
Step 6: Restart Fiji. StarDist plugin should now be available under Plugins > StarDist > StarDist 2D.

### Workshop Exercise 1: Segmentation
[Download TIF file](seminar_workkshop/images/HT29_nuclei.tif)
#### Global segmentation  
Open above image by dragging into the Fiji window and run Threshold command: <code>Image > Adjust > Threshold...</code>  
Choose different thresholding methods (such as Default, Huang, Otsu etc.) from the drop down list and check how they perform on your image.  
Once satisfied with a particular method or by manually selecting the lower and upper bounds (sliders), click on Apply button to generate a thresholded image.  

All thresholding methods (such as Default, Huang, Otsu etc.) can be tested at once by using <code>Image > Adjust > Auto Threshold</code>  
  
#### Local segmentation  
Select your original image and run the command: <code>Image > Adjust > Auto Local Threshold</code>  
Run with "Try all" methods to check which one gives the best result. For this image, the best segmentation is achieved with the *Phansalkar* method  

#### Deep Learning based segmentation using [StarDist](https://imagej.net/plugins/stardist)  
Select your original image and run the command: <code>Plugins › StarDist › StarDist 2D</code>  
In the follow up menu, choose Model: Versatile (fluorescent nuclei) and click on the "Set optimized thresholds" tab at the bottom. Keep the other deafult options. Click on OK.  
A segmentation label image will be genrated with the nuclei ROIs added to the ROI Manager.

[Download TIF file](seminar_workkshop/images/P31.tif)
  
- Open above time-lapse sequence in Fiji and run the command: <code> Plugins › Tracking › TrackMate</code>  
- You will be presented with a *TrackMate* window. Click Next.  
- Select *StarDist detector* from the drop-down menu (image A below). Click next.  
- You can now click on the *Preview* tab, to see how well StarDist is doing in detecting the nuclei on the current slice. If detections look fine, click next to detect nuclei in the whole time-lapse sequence.  
- Keep clicking next button until you reach the *Select a tracker* option (image B below). Select *Simple LAP tracker* and click next.  
- In the settings, choose Linking max distance=30 pixel, Gap-closing max distance=10 pixel, Gap-closing max frame gap=10. Click next.  
- Keep clicking next until you reach the *Display options* (image C below). Here, various display options fir the tracks could be selected. Choose *Show tracks backward in time*.  
- Please explore the three tabs at the bottom - *TrackScheme*, *Tracks* and *Spots*. A lot of statistics is hidden there, such as raw values for each nuclei in each frame of the time-lapse. All the statistics could be exported to a CSV file.  
- Keep clicking next until you reach the last window called *Select an action*. Select *Capture overlay* and click *Execute* to generate a time-lapse movie with spots and tracks overlaid on top of the original data.  
- A label time-lapse movie could also be generated by selecting *Export label image* from the drop-down list and clicking *Execute*
