Research Data Center at UC3M with access to DANE-Colombia 

We signed an agreement with DANE in 2021 to establish the first secure remote connection in Europe to the Colombian datasets managed by DANE. Thus, researchers who want to access private databases or private variables of public databases from DANE can request access to the data center located in the Department of Economics at UC3M. For additional details, please contact me.
