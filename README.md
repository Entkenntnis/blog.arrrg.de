Olá, I'm Bernardo ⚡ I'm Senior Machine Learning engineer based in Porto, Portugal 🇵🇹.

I build growth and pricing ML tools for B2B at **[McKinsey & Company](https://mckinsey.com)**. 

I'm the co-creator of **[Shipped Brain](http://shippedbrain.com)**, an E2E ML platform for easy model deployment, discovery and serving. I also like to code in **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** 🦀 and build fast advanced analytic (AA) tools.

I like developing core modules and tools for machine learning that businesses and practitioners can leverage, solving business problems with AI and employ MLOps. I lean towards streaming/real time systems and applied ML in quantitative finance and B2B.
