Hello. My name is Rakhmatjon Kholmurotov, I'm from Uzbekistan. i'm 30 years old. I graduated in 2020 in the University called [ISMA](https://www.isma.lv/en/) as Business Administrator. Currently living in Latvia, Riga. 

Last six months I'm strongly focused on the study of information technology because this area is developing very quickly. I study materials from the site [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/?utm=65b64f449aa748e1efd82aeea12b3c74&track=1&pt=2), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and I've created this site website for the first time.

Below examples of the materials which I have already learned:
