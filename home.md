## Hello, welcome to my personal webpage! 

#### I am a 5th-year Ph.D. student interested in labor economics and applied microeconomics, with a focus on questions related to migration. I am also a pre-doc researcher at the Institute for Economic Analysis (IAE)-CSIC in Barcelona and a short-term consultant at the World Bank. I did my bachelor's and master's degree in Economics at Universidad de Los Andes in Colombia. 

- I will be visiting [IRLE](https://irle.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley in the Fall-2022!
- You can download here a copy of my [CV](https://github.com/ludelgad/ludelgad.github.io/files/9427048/Delgado_CV.pdf).
- I am the co-organizer of the [Junior Economics of Migration Seminar](https://sites.google.com/view/the-economics-of-migration).
