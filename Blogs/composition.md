## Dodoman's Theme

This peice took me around 40 hours to compose over 4 months. It takes inspiration from Schubert St√§ndchen, Luigi's mansion and Kisame's Theme. It's not quite completely refined as I'm still seeking better alternatives to the 2nd movements and the ending. The transitions between the movements could also use work as well as further instrument volume balancing.

## 8 bit nostalgia

This piece originally written for solo piano has been switched over to a synthesizer. For some reason the melody, chord progression and synthesizer work well together in making it feel nostalgic. The easter egg ending uses a motif from guilty crown.
