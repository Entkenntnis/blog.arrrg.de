## Dodoman's Theme

This peice took me around 40 hours to compose over 4 months and I consider it to be my magnum opus thus far. It takes inspiration from Schubert St√§ndchen, Luigi's mansion and Kisame's Theme. It's not quite completely refined as I'm still seeking better alternatives to the 2nd movements and the ending. The transitions between the movements could also use work as well as further instrument volume balancing.

## 8 bit nostalgia

This piece originally written for solo piano has been switched over to a synthesizer. For some reason the melody, chord progression and synthesizer work well together in making it feel nostalgic. The easter egg ending uses a motif from guilty crown.

## 3 Hands Unknown

This 3 handed piece's motif is built off an unknown piece in past memories. The chord progresion is also inspired by another unknown piece. I had transcribed this without reference, but I had a clear idea in my head on what I wanted the chords to sound like as if I heard it before. If you know any reference material that sounds similar, let me know- I'm curious!

## Puddings day off

This is a bit of an experimental piece. It follows the day of the life of Pudding, my rabbit. It starts off tense as Pudding as today is vacuum day. Things suddenly calm down when the cleaning finishes. Immediately Pudding is no longer afraid. She flips over and takes a nap in the sun as her enemies are taken away to the basement (the vacuum).

## Spooky Noises

Even more experimental, I'm looking into ways to create tension and stress. Whether it would be for my animation or for a horror video game, this is a field I haven't studied much in. I'm looking into the words of Danny Elfman, bernard herrman and Krzystof Penderecki. This particular snippet is inspired also from Attack on Titan.
