# What's Desmos?

[Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) is an online graphing calculator whos appeal is owed to its abundant array of features, empowering users to craft splendid creations solely through the foundation of mathematics.

## Basic Graphing Functions

### Linear Functions

Linear functions are the simplest functions to both design and bound. In theory, a masterpiece could be indistinguishably approximated with sufficient linear functions given an infinitely powerful computer to render it on Desmos. However, due to computational restraints of the website and the amount of time it would to write (or generate) all linear functions, it's an infeasible method. Instead, we will use linear functions only for straight lines. This may be a promiment feature in the art depending on the theme. For example, a 2-point perspective city art will contain primarily straight lines, while organic drawings will contain almost none. 


Example:
$$\[ y = x + 2 \cdot \{ |x + 1| < 2 \} \]$$

Fun fact: that linear function bounds can be entirely described with a single variable.

### Polynomial Functions

Polynomials show up often in math classes, but it's function in art is less pronounced. Most degrees of polynomials simply don't have an important shape in art aside from possibly the quadratic. And even so most shapes you see in real life that look like a quadratic aren't. For example Catenary functions better describe hanging chains than quadratics. Polynomials functions in Desmos art truly only shines in motion. 

Catenary
$$\[ y = a \cosh\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \]$$ vs 
Quadratics
$$\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c \]$$


## Creating Art with Desmos

Desmos offers a creative playground for artists and math enthusiasts to generate intricate visual art using mathematical functions. By combining and manipulating equations, you can craft mesmerizing patterns and designs. One popular technique is using parametric equations to create intricate curves and shapes.

### Parametric Equations

Parametric equations introduce a pair of variables, usually denoted as $$x(t)$$ and $$y(t)$$, to define a curve. Here's an example of a parametric equation that generates a heart shape:

$$x(t) = 16 \sin^3(t)$$
$$y(t) = 13 \cos(t) - 5 \cos(2t) - 2 \cos(3t) - \cos(4t)$$

This equation set produces a beautiful heart curve.

## Conclusion

Desmos isn't just a tool for graphing functions; it's a canvas for creating mathematical art and exploring the visual side of math. Whether you're experimenting with basic functions or delving into more complex parametric equations, Desmos provides a platform for both education and artistic expression.
